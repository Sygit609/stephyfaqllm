    question: "How do I fix Instagram follow blocks?",
    answer: "If you're experiencing follow blocks on Instagram, slow down your activity. Instagram limits you to about 200 follows per day. Space out your follows to 10-15 per hour and take breaks. Also avoid using third-party automation tools as they trigger blocks faster.",

    answer: "Pricing varies based on niche and experience. Beginners: $300-500/month. Intermediate: $500-1000/month. Advanced: $1000-2500/month. Some members charge per conversation ($50-100) or per sale (10-20% commission). Start lower to build testimonials, then raise rates.",

To recover: pause activity for 48 hours, remove suspected hashtags, and gradually resume normal posting.",

Don't overthink it - you can always pivot. The best niche is one you can stick with for 6-12 months.",

    question: "What's the difference between a lead magnet and a tripwire?",
    answer: "Lead magnet = FREE opt-in gift to get email address (PDF, checklist, mini-course). Tripwire = LOW-COST impulse buy right after opt-in ($7-27 product). The tripwire turns cold subscribers into paying customers immediately, making ad costs profitable faster. Example: Free '10 DM Scripts' lead magnet → $17 'Complete DM Masterclass' tripwire.",

    answer: "Timeline varies widely: 3-6 months with consistent daily effort (2-3 posts/day + DM outreach). 6-12 months with moderate effort (1 post/day). Factors: niche competition, content quality, engagement strategy, and luck. Focus on engagement rate over follower count - 1000 engaged followers is better than 10k ghost followers.",

    answer: "Proven caption formula: 1) Hook (first line grabs attention) 2) Story or value (entertain or educate) 3) Call-to-action (DM, link in bio, comment). Keep first sentence short and punchy. Use line breaks for readability. End with a question to boost comments. Most important: be authentic - people buy from people they trust.",

    answer: "Industry benchmarks: 1-3% is average, 3-5% is good, 5%+ is excellent. Factors affecting conversion: offer quality, traffic source, landing page design, and audience match. If below 1%, your lead magnet likely doesn't solve a painful enough problem. Test different offers and headlines to optimize.",

    question: "Should I use Instagram Reels or static posts for growth?",
    answer: "Current consensus (Jan 2025): Reels get 3-5x more reach than static posts due to Instagram's algorithm prioritizing video. However, don't abandon static posts entirely - they work better for in-depth education and testimonials. Ideal mix: 60% Reels, 40% carousels/static. Quality over quantity always wins.",

Most OIL members use: '30-day money-back guarantee if you do the work and don't see results.' This protects you from serial refunders while building trust.",

Don't wait for perfection. Launch at 70% ready, get feedback, improve. Most successful OIL members started with a simple $27 offer and iterated based on customer feedback.",

Rule of thumb: if 80% of people say yes, you're too cheap. If 80% say no, you're too expensive. Sweet spot is 30-50% conversion.",

    answer: "Quality > quantity. Minimum: 1 post/day + 3-5 stories. Optimal: 1-2 posts/day + 5-10 stories. Maximum: 3 posts/day (more can hurt engagement). Consistency beats volume - better to do 1/day forever than 5/day for 2 weeks then quit. Focus on creating content people save and share, not just consume.",

    question: "What payment processor should I use for digital products?",
    answer: "Top recommendations: 1) Stripe - industry standard, 2.9% + 30¢, great for subscriptions. 2) PayPal - wider acceptance internationally, similar fees. 3) ThriveCart - one-time fee, built-in funnels. 4) Stan Store - specifically for Instagram creators. Most OIL members use Stripe because it integrates with everything and has excellent developer support.",

    question: "How do I deal with negative comments on Instagram?",
    answer: "Response framework: 1) Constructive criticism - thank them and address it. 2) Misinformed comments - politely correct with facts. 3) Trolls/hate - delete and block immediately (don't feed them). 4) Competitors - ignore. Your energy is better spent on people who support you. Remember: if you're getting hate, it means you're visible enough to threaten someone.",

    question: "What's the ideal email list size before launching a product?",
    answer: "You can launch with ANY size list - even 50 engaged subscribers. Real story: OIL member made $2,400 from 200 subscribers. What matters more: engagement rate and trust. Benchmark: 10% conversion is realistic. So with 500 subscribers, expect 50 sales. With 5000, expect 500 sales. Focus on quality of relationship over list size.",

    question: "How do I transition from 9-5 to full-time online business?",
    answer: "Safe transition plan: 1) Build side hustle to $3k/month while employed (6-12 months). 2) Save 6 months expenses. 3) Quit job OR negotiate part-time. 4) Scale to $10k/month (next 6-12 months). 5) Reinvest profits into growth. Don't quit too early - financial stress kills creativity. Don't wait too long - comfort kills ambition. Sweet spot: consistent $5k/month for 3 months.",

    question: "What's the best way to handle scope creep with clients?",
    answer: "Prevention > cure. Set boundaries upfront: 1) Written scope of work before starting 2) Clear deliverables and timeline 3) Change request process (additional fee for extras) 4) Response time expectations (24-48 hours, not instant). When it happens: remind them of original agreement professionally, offer to add extras as paid addons. Being kind but firm protects your time and profitability.",

    question: "Should I niche down or stay broad on Instagram?",
    answer: "Riches are in the niches. Broad = invisible. Specific = profitable. Bad niche: 'I help people with social media'. Good niche: 'I help female real estate agents get seller leads from Instagram'. The more specific, the easier to create content, attract ideal clients, and charge premium prices. You can always expand later once you dominate a micro-niche.",

    question: "What's the difference between cold and warm traffic?",
    answer: "Cold traffic = people who've never heard of you (ads, explore page). Warm traffic = people familiar with you (email list, social followers, past customers). Cold needs more nurturing before buying. Warm converts faster. That's why building an audience and email list is crucial - you're creating warm traffic you can sell to repeatedly at lower cost than constantly buying cold ads.",
