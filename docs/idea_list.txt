- allow admin to ask LLM base on the answer, to modify it, question it, or include optional admin input field tgt with student's question

- classify the type of posts, and which ai should handle what
(do this one first) (multiple type of questions so different agents for 1 post sometimes)
-maybe backend should classify as well?
__________________________________________

some posts are not questions, some are like sharing excitement, include LLM prompt setting to be able to respond to that accordingly

analyse types of fb posts, and funnel it to right tools/ agents accordingly

advanced (later)
include ability to include knowledge source the coaches prefer, to curate more indepth answer that are not covered in the course

screenshot function (copy paste, not download upload)

Side panel for llm faq tool to paste questions in or fish answer out conveniently

Need to think about how to arrange the ui and ux of time sensitive info like zoom date, time , links,.... Google calendar integration

for importing content, have option to copy paste post text from fb instead of screenshot, Question + answer(optional)(if no answer=unanswered)
of course include link as well

need to think about how to arrange the import content menu
since there are:
- Course transcript
- Facebook group posts
- Calendar (event dates, zoom link etc...) integrated w google calendar
- Other (in future maybe business books so that admin can come up with even more impressive and informed replies)


Maybe when searching can add gif (searching course, searching community posts, cooking with Ai...)
